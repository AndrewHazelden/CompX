# CompX

An OpenUSD schema for representing nodal compositing operators. Optimized for VFX and virtual production workflows.

## Project Status:

A new working group of VFX/animation/post-production/virtual production/game industry professionals is being assembled.

The goal is to create an OpenUSD based CompX schema, alongside a reference implementation that ships with the essential DCC plugins, command-line utilities, and libraries to support compositing data interchange.
